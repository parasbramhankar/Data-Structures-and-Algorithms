Implementation of Queue:


Implementing a queue using an array involves using a fixed-size array to store elements and two variables
(commonly called front and rear) to track the positions of elements, following the First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
principle.

Core Components

Array: The underlying data structure used to store the elements. It has a predefined, fixed size.

front variable: Points to the index of the element at the front of the queue (the element to be removed next).

rear variable: Points to the index where the next element will be inserted.

Initially:
front = -1
rear = -1

When the first element is added, both front and rear become 0.

When an element is inserted, rear is incremented.
When an element is removed, front is incremented.

Key Operations

The primary operations for an array-based queue are enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, and isFull.

---

1. Enqueue Operation (Inserting an element)

This operation adds a new element at the rear of the queue.

Algorithm:
Check if the queue is full (isFull()). If it is, an overflow condition occurs.
If the queue is empty, set front = 0.
Increment the rear index (rear++).
Place the new element at the rear position in the array (queue[rear] = value).

---

2. Dequeue Operation (Removing an element)

This operation removes and returns the front element from the queue.

Algorithm:
Check if the queue is empty (isEmpty()). If it is, an underflow condition occurs.
Retrieve the element at the front index (item = queue[front]).
If front == rear, set both front and rear to -1 (queue becomes empty).
Otherwise, increment the front index (front++).
Return the retrieved element.

---

3. Peek/Front Operation (Viewing the front element)

This operation returns the front element without removing it.

Algorithm:
Check if the queue is empty (isEmpty()).
If not empty, return the element at the front index (return queue[front]).

---

4. isEmpty() Operation

Checks if the queue is empty.

Condition:
The queue is empty if front == -1.

---

5. isFull() Operation

Checks if the queue has reached its maximum capacity (only applicable for fixed-size array implementations).

Condition:
The queue is full if rear == MAX_SIZE - 1 (where MAX_SIZE is the predefined capacity of the array).
