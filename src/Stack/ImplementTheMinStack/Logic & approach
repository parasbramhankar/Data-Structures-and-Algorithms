A Min Stack is a specialized stack data structure in Java that supports standard operations (push, pop, top) as well as an additional getMin operation, all in constant time (O(1)).
The most common and clean approach to implement a Min Stack in Java is by using two java.util.Stack objects: one to store all elements (mainStack) and an auxiliary one to keep track of the minimum elements (minStack).



Java Implementation (Two Stacks Approach)
//***
import java.util.Stack;

class MinStack {
    private Stack<Integer> mainStack;
    private Stack<Integer> minStack;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MinStack() {
        mainStack = new Stack<>();
        minStack = new Stack<>();
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        mainStack.push(val);
        if (minStack.isEmpty() || val <= minStack.peek()) {
            minStack.push(val);
        } else {
            // If the new value is not the new minimum, push the current minimum again
            minStack.push(minStack.peek());
        }
    }

    public void pop() {
        // Pop from both stacks to maintain synchronization
        if (!mainStack.isEmpty()) {
            mainStack.pop();
            minStack.pop();
        }
    }

    public int top() {
        return mainStack.peek();
    }

    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.peek();
    }
}
**///
Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations (push, pop, top, getMin).
Space Complexity: O(n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the stack, as both stacks can store up to 'n' elements.

Key Operations Explained
push(int val): The value is always added to the mainStack.
It is added to the minStack only if it is less than or equal to the current minimum.
This ensures the top of minStack always holds the minimum of the mainStack up to that point.

pop(): The top element is removed from both stacks simultaneously to keep them aligned.
After popping, the top of the minStack automatically becomes the next minimum for the remaining elements.

top(): Returns the top element of the mainStack.

getMin(): Returns the top element of the minStack.

This approach guarantees constant time performance for all required operations by using auxiliary space to track the minimum at each step.
