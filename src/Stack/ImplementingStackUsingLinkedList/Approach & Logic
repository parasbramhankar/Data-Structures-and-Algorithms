The proper approach and logic to implement a stack using a linked list are:

- A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where the most recently added element is the first to be removed.
- In the linked list implementation, each element of the stack is represented by a node that holds the data and a reference to the next node.
- The top of the stack is represented by the head node of the linked list.

- Push: To push an element:
  - Create a new node with the desired data.
  - Set the new node’s next pointer to the current top node.
  - Update the top pointer to this new node.

- Pop: To pop an element:
  - Check if the stack is empty; if empty, return an error or indication.
  - Retrieve the data from the top node.
  - Update the top pointer to the next node in the linked list.
  - Return the retrieved data.

- Peek: To peek the top element:
  - Return the data from the top node without removing it.

- The stack dynamically grows and shrinks as nodes are added or removed, without any fixed size limit.
- All principal stack operations (push, pop, peek) take constant time $$O(1)$$ because they involve manipulating the head of the linked list.
- This approach efficiently maintains the stack’s LIFO behavior by inserting and removing elements only at the head of the list.

In this manner, the linked list acts as a flexible and dynamic structure to implement the stack, ensuring efficient memory usage and fast stack operations.[1][2][4]
