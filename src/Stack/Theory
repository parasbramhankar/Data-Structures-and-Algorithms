Definition and Real-Life Analogy
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle,
meaning the last element inserted into the stack is the first one to be removed.

Example: Think of it like a stack of plates: you can only add or remove the top plate.

 Working Principle (LIFO Concept)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You can push (add) an element onto the top.
- You can pop (remove) the top element.
- The last item pushed is always the first one popped.

 Core Operations and Their Explanation

| Operation |           Description      | Example using stack of books |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| push      | Add item to the top        | Put a new book on top |
| pop       | Remove top item            | Take the top book off the stack |
| peek      | View top item without      |
|           |  removing                  | Look at the top book without taking it off |
| isEmpty   | Check if stack is empty    | Check if there are any books left |
| isFull    | Check if stack is full     |
|           |(only applies to fixed size)| Check if shelf space is full |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-by-step Example for Operations:
------------------------------------
Initial stack: []
Push 10: [10]
Push 20: [10, 20]
Peek: 20 (top element)
Pop: removes 20, stack: [10]
IsEmpty: false
IsFull (if max size = 2): true
------------------------------------


Internal Implementation in Java
--------------------------------
# Using Array (Static Stack)
    - Uses a fixed-size array.
    - Maintains an index `top` to track the current top.
    - When full, cannot push more elements without resizing.

-------------------------------------------------
# Using Linked List (Dynamic Stack)
    - Each element points to the next.
    - No fixed size, grows/shrinks dynamically.
    - Slightly more memory overhead due to node pointers.

 Time and Space Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| push      | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| pop       | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| peek      | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| isEmpty   | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| isFull    | O(1)            | O(1)             |

Array-based stack has fixed space at initialization, while linked list stack grows dynamically.

 Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Simple to implement and use.
- Useful for recursion, backtracking, undo operations, syntax parsing, etc.
- Constant time operations.

Disadvantages:
- Static array stack wastes space if max size is too large.
- Array stack can overflow if capacity is exceeded.
- Linked list stack uses extra memory for pointers.

 Applications in Real Life and Programming
- Undo mechanisms in text editors.
- Browser back button history.
- Expression evaluation and syntax parsing.
- Call stack in recursion.
- Function call management in programming languages.

 Difference Between Static and Dynamic Stacks

| Feature              | Static Stack (Array)            | Dynamic Stack (Linked List)       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Size                 | Fixed at creation               | Grows/shrinks dynamically        |
| Memory usage         | May waste space if over-allocated | Uses space proportional to elements |
| Overflow             | Can occur if full               | No overflow unless memory limits |
| Implementation      | Simple index manipulation       | Node creation and pointer linking |
